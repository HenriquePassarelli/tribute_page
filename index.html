        <div class="brief">
            <p>Linus Torvalds, (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland), Finnish computer scientist who was the
                principal force behind the development of the Linux operating system.</p>

        <div class="History">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer programming on his grandfather’s Commodore VIC-20. In
                1991, while a computer science student at the University of Helsinki (M.S., 1996), he purchased his
                first personal computer (PC). He was not satisfied, however, with the computer’s operating system (OS).
                His PC used MS-DOS (the disk operating system from Microsoft Corp.), but Torvalds preferred the UNIX
                operating system he had used on the university’s computers. He decided to create his own PC-based
                version of UNIX. Months of determined programming work yielded the beginnings of an operating system
                known as Linux. In 1991 he posted a message on the Internet to alert other PC users to his new system,
                made the software available for free downloading, and, as was a common practice among software
                developers at the time, he released the source code, which meant that anyone with knowledge of computer
                programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes. Because of their access to the source code,
                many programmers helped Torvalds retool and refine the software, and by 1994 Linux kernel (original
                code) version 1.0 was released.</p>

            <p>
                Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds: to create a new free
                operating system kernel. The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its
                history. Since the initial release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from a small number of C
                files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018 with more than
                23.3 million lines of source code, not counting comments,[1] under the GNU General Public License v2.

                <b>Subsurface</b> is a piece of software for logging and planning scuba dives. It was initially designed
                and developed by Linus Torvalds and Dirk Hohndel in 2011. Subsurface is free and open-source software
                distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>Linus Torvalds is married to Tove Torvalds (born Monni)—a six-time Finnish national karate champion—whom
                he first met in late 1993. Linus was running introductory computer laboratory exercises for students and
                instructed the course attendees to send him an e-mail as a test, to which Tove responded with an e-mail
                asking for a date. Tove and Linus were later married and have three daughters, two of whom were born
                in the United States. The Linux kernel's reboot system call accepts their dates of birth (written in
                hexadecimal) as magic values.</p>
